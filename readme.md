Pizarron
========

# New technologies

Pizarron will be the recreation of whiteboard, as you may know, whiteboard was made using Microsoft's technologies.

For now, we pretend to create this software with open technologies, such as PHP with Laravel Framework, NodeJS with socket.io, and so on.

# Features

The main features we pretend to do are:

* Creation of organization and courses
* Live streaming of classes via our "pizarron", audio live streaming and chat
* Creation of "homework" or quizes
* Social networks integration
